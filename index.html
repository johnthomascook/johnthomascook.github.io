<p>Building businesses that are centered around the user and leverage data and technology to execute this vision is my passion. Following this passion is how I will push forward the human experiment.</p>

<p>My passion is technology and I wanted to dig deeper into...Digital Marketing, Analytics, Technology Interaction, Social psychology, User-centered design, Customer Development, and the Lean Startup.

<p>Today my focus is taking this diverse set of knowledge and applying it to build startups & digital businesses.</p>
